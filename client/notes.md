Still need:

* Something that changes effect of non proximal particles.  Probably a hue change over time.
* Different colors/effects for different person.
* Scale down particles on the way in and scale up on the way out (maybe)
* Figure out why particles are always moving left (has to do with noise period i think).
* Use joint angles to do something (angle between)
* Background should be dark, and non proximal points should be low contrast

* Downward movement causes lower lightness, upward movement causes higher lightness
* Arm position causes change in hue
* Something changes alpha?
