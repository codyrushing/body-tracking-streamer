Both [PoseNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/posenet) and [BodyPix](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/body-pix) have been released for TensorFlowJS, but they are only designed to run in the browser.  However, it's pretty easy to shim it to work for Node, [and this person has done exactly that for PoseNet (!)](https://github.com/Bluebie/nzsl-training-data-generator).  They even include a strategy for how to pull frames off of a video using ffmpeg.  This is a great place to start.
